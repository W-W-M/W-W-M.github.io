I am currently and a PDRA at the University of Manchester, supervised by Prof. Charlie C.L. Wang.
I was an associate professor at Dalian University of Technology. 
I obtained my bachelor (2010) and doctoral (2016) degree at Dalian University of Technology, 
supervised by Prof. Xiuping Liu.
From Sept. 2011 to June 2014, I visited the Zhejiang University and University of Science and Technology of 
China, supervised by Prof. Ligang Liu. 
From Oct. 2014 to Oct. 2015, I visited the Computer Graphics & Multimedia Lab at RWTH 
Aachen University, supervised by Prof. Leif Kobbelt. Supported by Marie Sklodowska Curia 
LEaDing Fellows Postdocs Programme, I spent two years and two months worked in the Delft University 
of Technology, co-supervised by Prof. Jun Wu, Charlie C.L. Wang, and 
Fred van Keulen. From July 2018 to Nov 2020, I worked as a postdoc researcher at Dalian University of 
Technology, supervised by Prof. Baocai Yin. One of my work received the International Society of 
Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (ISSMO)/ Springer prize, and the other work received the 
GDC 2021 Best Paper Award.
