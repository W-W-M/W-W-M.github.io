I am currently a Professor at Nanjing Unviersity of Science and Technology. 
I was an associate professor at Dalian University of Technology. 
I obtained my bachelor and doctoral degrees at Dalian University of Technology, 
supervised by Prof. Xiuping Liu.
I visited the Zhejiang University and the University of Science and Technology of 
China (supervised by Prof. Ligang Liu), and the Computer Graphics & Multimedia Lab at RWTH 
Aachen University (supervised by Prof. Leif Kobbelt). I was a postdoc researcher at Dalian University of 
Technology (supervised by Prof. Baocai Yin), a postdoc researcher supported by Marie Sklodowska Curia 
LEaDing Fellows Postdocs Programme at the Delft University 
of Technology (co-supervised by Prof. Jun Wu, Charlie C.L. Wang, and 
Fred van Keulen) and, a PDRA at the University of Manchester (supervised by Prof. Charlie C.L. Wang). 

My research works were received the International Society of 
Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (ISSMO)/ Springer prize, the 
GDC 2021 Best Paper Award, and the first Test-of-Time Award of Siggraph Asia (2023), etc.
