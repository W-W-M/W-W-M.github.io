I am currently an associate professor in School of Mathematical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology,
 and a PDRA in the School of Engineering, University of Manchester, collaborated with Prof. Charlie C.L. Wang.
I obtained my bachelor degree from Information and Computing Science at Dalian University of Technology in June 2010, 
and doctor degree from computational mathematics at Dalian University of Technology in June 2016, 
supervised by Prof. Xiuping Liu.
From Sept. 2011 to Mar. 2012, I spent half a year visiting the Applied Mathematics in the Department 
of Mathematics at Zhejiang University, under the supervison of Prof. Ligang Liu. From Mar. 2012 to June 2014, 
I spent half and two years visiting the Graphics&Geometric Computing Laboratory in School of Mathematical 
Sciences at University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of Prof. Ligang Liu. 
From Oct. 2014 to Oct. 2015, I spent one year visiting the Computer Graphics & Multimedia Lab at RWTH 
Aachen University, under the supervision of Prof. Leif Kobbelt. Supported by Marie Sklodowska Curia 
LEaDing Fellows Postdocs Programme, from April 2018 I spent two years and two months in Delft University 
of Technology, Department of Design Engineering, co-supervised by Prof. Jun Wu, Charlie C.L. Wang, and 
Fred van Keulen. From July 2018 to Nov 2020, I worked as a postdoc researcher in the School of Computer 
Science and Technology,  Dalian University of Technology, supervised by Prof. Baocai Yin.
